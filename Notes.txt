Project scoping:

Needs: 
1. Map w/ Expo Mapview
  - Address hardcoded into constant passed in props
  - Geocode the address into lat long (async) - expo location solves this
  - Set lat long as region in state
  - Use region state for mapView to move map

2. Data needs:
  - Name - Fells Wargo's Parking lot
  - Address - Any
  - Spot #
  - Start Date
  - End Date
  - Cost
  - User Name
  - User profile image
  - User relationship?


------ Working Notes

--- Map Start
- Started by getting the map on the screen w/ expo maps. Started with this as I wanted to build from the back to the front for simplicity.
- Recognized mapview requires lat/long, so wanted to geocode a standard address to set the region
- Location.geocodeAsync is async so putting the entire function in a useEffect
- Setting state in the function in useEffect so the response isn't a promise but is instead the array
- Rendering the map gives us an undefined state on first render, adding a conditional to check for coords state to have info to render map or render loading
- Map is rendering to the correct location after setting a region state and using that as the mapView region
- After looking at figma decided to use a relative/absolute positioning approach to overlay screens

--- Map complete ~30 minutes

--- Reservation screen
- Background used a color instead of image - set opacity.
- Fonts loaded with expo-font hooks
- Add in assets
